# Build-A-Thon

> Hackathon project focused on building an end-to-end product with a frontend, backend, and ML model.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project is divided into three components:

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `frontend/` | UI & user-facing application |
| `backend/` | Server, routes, business logic, APIs |
| `classification model/` | Machine Learning scripts/notebooks |

Goal: Deliver a working MVP that solves a real user problem using clean architecture and fast execution.

---

## ✅ Features

- User authentication (login/signup)
- Dashboard for user input
- ML model for classification / recommendation
- API integration
- Clean, modular code structure
- Responsive frontend

(Add/remove features based on your actual implementation.)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| Frontend | JavaScript + (React/Vite/etc.) |
| Backend | Node.js / Express (or according to your repo) |
| ML | Python + Jupyter Notebook + Scikit-learn/TensorFlow |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |

(Replace placeholders with the exact frameworks you used.)

Copy code
cd backend
npm install
npm start
If using Python backend instead:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Frontend Setup
bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
ML / Classification Model
bash
Copy code
cd ../"classification model"
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook/script to retrain or test.

If you want, I can also generate:

- Hackathon PPT content
- Architecture diagram
- Demo script for judges

Just say: **“Generate PPT slides content.”**
